## GAME NOTES

# CONCEPT
* The idea of the game is that there will be a kid hero character who has found a summoning book connected to an alternate dimension.
* She summons random monsters to fight by her side while traversing a dangerous land.  Each summoned monster will assist her survival and escape from the area.
* It costs pages of the book to summon monsters, so her spells are limited.  Each monster summoned -- even the most mundane -- will be an asset to her survival.
